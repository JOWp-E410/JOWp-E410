## Welcome to my CTF writeup page

I will be documenting my steps into capture the flag style learning and problem solving, and hopefully improving my communication style

### About me

I am currently studying part time for an infosec degree, while working full time. I've always been interested in computers since receiving my first ZX Spectrum. Throughout the years I've dabbled but never really commited to relearning. Now my children are older, I've rediscovered my passion.

I've been consuming content from https://academy.hackthebox.com, https://tryhackme.com and various others sources. However I decided to cut my teeth with some https://play.picoctf.org
